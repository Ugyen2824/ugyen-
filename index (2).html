    <p>We are working to change the way the world works, to end animal<mark> <strong> cruelty</strong> </mark> and <mark><strong>suffering</strong></mark> forerver . together we will take on the global system that fuel aniaml abuse to end the <strong> <i>root</i> </strong> cause of the suffering. our work is focused on two primary goals, transforming the global food system and stopping the exploitation of wild Animals. From the jungle to the oceans, wild animals face ongoing threats of cruelty and abuse. Bears are captured and forced to fight dogs. Marine mammals, such as whales and dolphins, forced to perform in <mark>cruel entertainment venues</mark>. Wild animals are traded as exotic pets or unproven medicine.

        But long-lasting, genuine change is possible, so we move governments and communities worldwide to protect these wild animals and by supporting our campaigns, you can help to keep <strong> <mark> <i>wild animals safe and wild </i> </mark> </strong> </p>

        <p>At hope Donors, we strongly believe that animals deserve to live their life free of pain and full of hope and love. Therefore, we try to give them the life we believe they deserve on a daily basis. However, we need your help to reach out and help more of them.

            Unfortunately, in many parts of the world animals are stray with no one to take care of them or are being abandoned by their owners. Animal abandonment is a <mark>widespread issue, with only 11%</mark> of abandoned entering shelters as strays are returned or taken back by their owners. Many of them become ill, injure or suffer abuses on the streets and require doctors, medicine, surgeries, and shelter to survive. Depending on the nature of illness or injury, veterinary costs including surgery can exceed $8,000.
            
            At Hope Donors, we are saving the animals.<strong><i> We find, provide medical care and shelter to give them the life they deserve.</i> </strong> kindly ask you to donate hope and love to these animals and help us to keep our promises to them.</p>
